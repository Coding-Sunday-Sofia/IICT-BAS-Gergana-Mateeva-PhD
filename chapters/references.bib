abstract = {Despite the slowdown in the economy, advertisement revenue remains a significant source of income for many Internet-based organizations. Banner advertisements form a critical component of this income, accounting for 40 to 50 percent of the total revenue. There are considerable gains to be realized through the efficient scheduling of banner advertisements. This problem has been observed to be intractable via traditional optimization techniques, and has received only limited attention in the literature. This paper presents a procedure to generate advertisement schedules under the most commonly used advertisement pricing scheme---the CPM model. The solution approach is based on Lagrangean decomposition and is seen to provide extremely good advertisement schedules in a relatively short period of time, taking only a few hundred seconds of elapsed time on a 450 MHz PC compared to a few thousand seconds of CPU time on a workstation that other approaches need. Additionally, this approach can be incorporated into an actual implementation with minimal alterations and hence is of particular interest.},

Fueled by this trend, the online advertising industry is experiencing unprecedented revenue growth. One of the most important drivers of this revenue is banner advertising, which has long been a staple of the online advertising industry. Previous research has introduced quantitative models and solution approaches for the challenging basic scheduling optimization problem. We extend this work by incorporating the most common and popular trend in the in the industry, online advertisement targeting. In addition, motivated by the NP-hard nature of the resulting problem, we propose and test several heuristic and metaheuristic based solution techniques for the proposed problem.}

For online ads that attract click-throughs, we use click through rates to develop a methodology for customizing advertisements on the fly by changing content, copy, placement, animation and other attributes. We use techniques from optimization, conjoint analysis and genetic algorithms. Ads are reconstituted on the fly using graphic files for each level of each attribute, much like a painter would use a palette. We show that this approach improves response rates, reduces server storage requirements and improves ad efficiency.}

Advertisements shown within websites form a major source of revenue for web publishers. Naturally, the proper planning and allocation of advertisement space in the webpages becomes a major factor in the profitability of the business model. This paper addresses the problem of determining efficient placement of advertisements on a two-dimensional web banner with the objective of maximizing revenue. An integer programming mathematical model is developed here to optimally place advertisements on a two-dimensional banner. The performance of the new formulation is compared with models existing in the recent literature. The proposed model is also validated with computational analysis to prove its efficacy.},

abstract = {Online banner advertisement, which is the most common form of web advertising, has been catching the eye of online users. It is important for online advertisement publishers to schedule advertisements to maximize advertising effectiveness, which might be a predicted value of click-through-rate. In this paper, a model for online banner advertisement scheduling is presented with a new objective function that includes four factors that influence advertising effectiveness. This paper provides not only the integer programming model with a non-linear objective function but also two heuristic and meta-heuristic algorithms as solution methodologies. Most importantly, the heuristic approach finds good lower and upper bounds by using the properties of the model. Both randomly generated and standard data sets are used to test the problem. The results indicate the effectiveness and efficiency of these algorithms tested in small and large data sets. In standard data sets, the results show the advertisement specification for which tighter bounds are obtained by using the heuristic approach.}

abstract = {Many web sites (e.g. Hotmail, Yahoo) provide free services to the users while generating revenues from advertising. Advertising revenue is, therefore, critical for these sites. This in turn raises the question, how should advertisements at a web site be scheduled in a planning horizon to maximize revenue. Advertisements on the web are specified by geometry and display frequency and both of these factors need to be considered in developing a solution to the advertisement scheduling problem. Since this problem belongs to the class of NP-hard problems, we first develop a heuristic called LSMF to solve the problem. This heuristic is then combined with a genetic algorithm (GA) to develop a hybrid GA. The hybrid GA solution is first compared with the upper bound obtained by running CPLEX for the integer programming formulation of the problem. It is then also compared with an existing algorithm proposed in the literature. Our computational results show that the hybrid GA performs exceptionally well in the sense that it provides optimal or near optimal solution for a wide range of problem instances of realistic sizes and the improvements over existing algorithm are substantial. Finally we present a case study to illustrate how revenue could be significantly increased with a small improvement in the advertisement schedule. It is the first such study in this setup.}

abstract = {Online advertising campaigns have attracted the attention of many advertisers willing to promote their business on the Internet. One of the main problems faced by advertisers, especially by those who have little experience in Internet advertising, is configuring their campaigns in an efficient way. To configure a campaign properly it is required to select the appropriate target, so it is guaranteed a high acceptance of users to adverts. It is also required that the number of visits that satisfy the configuration requirements is high enough to cover the advertisers’ campaigns. Thus, this paper presents a novel methodology for optimizing the micro-targeting technique in direct response display advertising campaigns by using genetic algorithms as the basis optimization model and a machine-learning based click-through rate (CTR) model. We implement our methodology to optimize display advertising campaigns on mobile devices using a real dataset. Results show that our methodology is feasible to optimize the campaigns by selecting the set of the best features required. Also, customization of the advertising campaign selecting some features by an advertiser, e.g. applying micro-targeting, can be optimized efficiently.}

abstract = { A key task of advertising media planners is to determine the best media schedule of advertising exposures for a certain budget. Conceptually, the planner could choose to do continuous advertising (i.e., schedule ad exposures evenly over all weeks) or follow a strategy of pulsing (i.e., advertise in some weeks of the year and not at other times). Previous theoretical analyses have shown that continuous advertising is optimal for nearly all situations. However, pulsing schedules are very common in practice. Either the practice of pulsing is inappropriate or extant models have not adequately conceptualized the effects of advertising spending over time. This paper offers a model that shows pulsing strategies can generate greater total awareness than the continuous advertising when the effectiveness of advertisement (i.e., ad quality) varies over time. Specifically, ad quality declines because of advertising wearout during periods of continuous advertising and it restores, due to forgetting effects, during periods of no advertising. Such dynamics make it worth-while for advertisers to stop advertising when ad quality becomes very low and wait for ad quality to restore before starting the next “burst” again, as is common in practice. Based on the extensive behavioral research on advertising repetition and advertising wearout, we extend the classical Nerlove and Arrow (1962) model by incorporating the notions of repetition wearout, copy wearout, and ad quality restoration. Repetition wearout is a result of excessive frequency because ad viewers perceive that there is nothing new to be gained from processing the ad, they withdraw their attention, or they become unmotivated to react to advertising information. Copy wearout refers to the decline in ad quality due to passage of time independent of the level of frequency. Ad quality restoration is the enhancement of ad quality during media hiatus as a consequence of viewers forgetting the details of the advertised messages, thus making ads appear “like new” when reintroduced later. The proposed model has the property that, when wearout effects are present, a strategy of pulsing is superior to continuous advertising even when the advertising response function is concave. This is illustrated by a numerical example that compares the total awareness generated by a single concentrated pulse of varying duration (blitz schedules) and continuous advertising (the even schedule). This property can be explained by the tension between the pressure to spend the fixed media budget quickly to avoid copy wearout and the opposing pressure to spread out the media spending over time to mitigate repetition wearout. The proposed model is empirically tested by using brand-level data from two advertising awareness tracking studies that also include the actual spending schedules. The first data set is for a major cereal brand, while the other is for a brand of milk chocolate. Such advertising tracking studies are now a common and popular means for evaluating advertising effectiveness in many markets (e.g., Millward Brown, MarketMind). In the empirical tests, the model parameters are estimated by using the Kalman filter procedure, which is eminently suited for dynamic models because it attends to the intertemporal dependencies in awareness build-up and decay via the use of conditional densities. The estimated parameters are statistically significant, have the expected signs, and are meaningful from both theoretical and managerial viewpoints. The proposed model fits both the data sets rather well and better than several well-known advertising models, namely, the Vidale-Wolfe, Brandaid, Litmus, and Tracker models, but not decisively better than the Nerlove-Arrow model. However, unlike the Nerlove-Arrow model, the proposed model yields different total awareness for different strategies of spending the same fixed budget, thus allowing media planners to discriminate among several media schedules. Given the empirical support for the model, the paper presents an implementable approach for utilizing it to evaluate large numbers of alternative media schedules and determine the best set of media schedules for consideration in media planning. This approach is based on an algorithm that combines a genetic algorithm with the Kalman filter procedure. The paper presents the results of applying this approach in the case studies of the cereal and milk chocolate brands. The form of the best advertising spending strategies in each case was a pulsing strategy, and there were many schedules that were an improvement over the media schedule actually used in each campaign. }
