abstract = {Despite the slowdown in the economy, advertisement revenue remains a significant source of income for many Internet-based organizations. Banner advertisements form a critical component of this income, accounting for 40 to 50 percent of the total revenue. There are considerable gains to be realized through the efficient scheduling of banner advertisements. This problem has been observed to be intractable via traditional optimization techniques, and has received only limited attention in the literature. This paper presents a procedure to generate advertisement schedules under the most commonly used advertisement pricing scheme---the CPM model. The solution approach is based on Lagrangean decomposition and is seen to provide extremely good advertisement schedules in a relatively short period of time, taking only a few hundred seconds of elapsed time on a 450 MHz PC compared to a few thousand seconds of CPU time on a workstation that other approaches need. Additionally, this approach can be incorporated into an actual implementation with minimal alterations and hence is of particular interest.},

abstract = {Worldwide growth of the online community continues to push the popularity of internet marketing. Fueled by this trend, the online advertising industry is experiencing unprecedented revenue growth. One of the most important drivers of this revenue is banner advertising, which has long been a staple of the online advertising industry. Previous research has introduced quantitative models and solution approaches for the challenging basic scheduling optimization problem. We extend this work by incorporating the most common and popular trend in the in the industry, online advertisement targeting. In addition, motivated by the NP-hard nature of the resulting problem, we propose and test several heuristic and metaheuristic based solution techniques for the proposed problem.}

abstract = {Online advertising campaigns have attracted the attention of many advertisers willing to promote their business on the Internet. One of the main problems faced by advertisers, especially by those who have little experience in Internet advertising, is configuring their campaigns in an efficient way. To configure a campaign properly it is required to select the appropriate target, so it is guaranteed a high acceptance of users to adverts. It is also required that the number of visits that satisfy the configuration requirements is high enough to cover the advertisers’ campaigns. Thus, this paper presents a novel methodology for optimizing the micro-targeting technique in direct response display advertising campaigns by using genetic algorithms as the basis optimization model and a machine-learning based click-through rate (CTR) model. We implement our methodology to optimize display advertising campaigns on mobile devices using a real dataset. Results show that our methodology is feasible to optimize the campaigns by selecting the set of the best features required. Also, customization of the advertising campaign selecting some features by an advertiser, e.g. applying micro-targeting, can be optimized efficiently.}
