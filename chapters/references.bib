abstract = {Online promotion is considered one of the most effective promotion approach, due to affordable costs and long-term effects. Online promotion is actually a set of SEM techniques and actions such as SEO (Search Engine Optimization), web directory submission, Google Adwords sponsored links, email marketing, viral marketing, banner exchange, bannerclassical promotion, social networking, social media and others (blogging, affiliate marketing, etc). To highlight the making of an online marketing campaign through Google Adwords we can use the example of a beauty salon. Within the AdWords campaign which was organized to promote this salon, four different ad groups were created in order to cover a wide range of searches. The AdWords advertising campaign was launched on the 1st of August 2011, after a carefully investigating online promotion techniques as well as studying methods and techniques used by competitors. At the same timethe optimization of the analyzed salon‘s website was done through SEO - Search Engine Optimization. For the considered period of time (May 27th - June 26th 2012) we can observe that the site salonuldefrumusete.ro had 6776 visits. Thus, 5780 visits (85.3%) came from search engines, Google holding a percentage of 99.1% (5728 visits). Direct visits (typing www.salonuldefrumuseteS.ro) on the salon‘s site were 414 (6.11%). Other important site visits sources are the directories where the salon‘s site was indexed, body treatments promotional articles published in specialized online journals (www.eva.ro, www.ele.ro, www.idieta.ro, etc.) and the salon‘s indexing on websites that promotes exclusively beauty salons (www.e-saloane.ro). The number of clients from these sources is 340 (5.02%). Visits coming from the newsletter which was sent to clients in the salon‘s database was 242, representing 3.57% of all visits. Given the success of the online marketing campaign based on Google AdWords, we sugggest to continue it, with the following objectives: refinement of the keywords to increase click rates, tracking progress positioning for all keywords in order to optimize them. It is essential to select those words and phrases designed not only to bring traffic to your site, but traffic to include as many potential clients. Also it is suggested to take into consideration the increasing awareness in the online environment.}

Banner advertisements form a critical component of this income, accounting for 40 to 50 percent of the total revenue. There are considerable gains to be realized through the efficient scheduling of banner advertisements. This problem has been observed to be intractable via traditional optimization techniques, and has received only limited attention in the literature. This paper presents a procedure to generate advertisement schedules under the most commonly used advertisement pricing scheme---the CPM model. The solution approach is based on Lagrangean decomposition and is seen to provide extremely good advertisement schedules in a relatively short period of time, taking only a few hundred seconds of elapsed time on a 450 MHz PC compared to a few thousand seconds of CPU time on a workstation that other approaches need. Additionally, this approach can be incorporated into an actual implementation with minimal alterations and hence is of particular interest.},

  abstract={Online advertising continues to be a significant source of income for many Internet-based organizations. Recent indications of improved economic growth are having an impact on advertisement revenue, with the estimated online advertising revenue in the United States for the fourth quarter of 2003 totaling a record of $2.2 billion. A substantial portion of this income comes from banner advertisements, and efficient scheduling of these advertisements could result in a considerable increase in profits. The problem of scheduling banner advertisements has been observed to be intractable via traditional optimization techniques and has received only limited attention in the literature. In addition, all past attempts to address this problem have been based on an "all-or-nothing" framework, where a customer specifies the exact number of copies of the ad to be displayed over the planning horizon, if it is selected for display by the provider of the advertisement space. This paper extends it to a more realistic setting, where the customer is allowed to specify a set of acceptable display frequencies. The Lagrangian decomposition-based solution approaches presented in this paper are observed to provide good schedules in a reasonable period of time.}

It is important for online advertisement publishers to schedule advertisements to maximize advertising effectiveness, which might be a predicted value of click-through-rate. In this paper, a model for online banner advertisement scheduling is presented with a new objective function that includes four factors that influence advertising effectiveness. This paper provides not only the integer programming model with a non-linear objective function but also two heuristic and meta-heuristic algorithms as solution methodologies. Most importantly, the heuristic approach finds good lower and upper bounds by using the properties of the model. Both randomly generated and standard data sets are used to test the problem. The results indicate the effectiveness and efficiency of these algorithms tested in small and large data sets. In standard data sets, the results show the advertisement specification for which tighter bounds are obtained by using the heuristic approach.}

abstract = {Many web sites (e.g. Hotmail, Yahoo) provide free services to the users while generating revenues from advertising. Advertising revenue is, therefore, critical for these sites. This in turn raises the question, how should advertisements at a web site be scheduled in a planning horizon to maximize revenue. Advertisements on the web are specified by geometry and display frequency and both of these factors need to be considered in developing a solution to the advertisement scheduling problem. Since this problem belongs to the class of NP-hard problems, we first develop a heuristic called LSMF to solve the problem. This heuristic is then combined with a genetic algorithm (GA) to develop a hybrid GA. The hybrid GA solution is first compared with the upper bound obtained by running CPLEX for the integer programming formulation of the problem. It is then also compared with an existing algorithm proposed in the literature. Our computational results show that the hybrid GA performs exceptionally well in the sense that it provides optimal or near optimal solution for a wide range of problem instances of realistic sizes and the improvements over existing algorithm are substantial. Finally we present a case study to illustrate how revenue could be significantly increased with a small improvement in the advertisement schedule. It is the first such study in this setup.}

One of the main problems faced by advertisers, especially by those who have little experience in Internet advertising, is configuring their campaigns in an efficient way. To configure a campaign properly it is required to select the appropriate target, so it is guaranteed a high acceptance of users to adverts. It is also required that the number of visits that satisfy the configuration requirements is high enough to cover the advertisers’ campaigns. Thus, this paper presents a novel methodology for optimizing the micro-targeting technique in direct response display advertising campaigns by using genetic algorithms as the basis optimization model and a machine-learning based click-through rate (CTR) model. We implement our methodology to optimize display advertising campaigns on mobile devices using a real dataset. Results show that our methodology is feasible to optimize the campaigns by selecting the set of the best features required. Also, customization of the advertising campaign selecting some features by an advertiser, e.g. applying micro-targeting, can be optimized efficiently.}

abstract = { A key task of advertising media planners is to determine the best media schedule of advertising exposures for a certain budget. Conceptually, the planner could choose to do continuous advertising (i.e., schedule ad exposures evenly over all weeks) or follow a strategy of pulsing (i.e., advertise in some weeks of the year and not at other times). Previous theoretical analyses have shown that continuous advertising is optimal for nearly all situations. However, pulsing schedules are very common in practice. Either the practice of pulsing is inappropriate or extant models have not adequately conceptualized the effects of advertising spending over time. This paper offers a model that shows pulsing strategies can generate greater total awareness than the continuous advertising when the effectiveness of advertisement (i.e., ad quality) varies over time. Specifically, ad quality declines because of advertising wearout during periods of continuous advertising and it restores, due to forgetting effects, during periods of no advertising. Such dynamics make it worth-while for advertisers to stop advertising when ad quality becomes very low and wait for ad quality to restore before starting the next “burst” again, as is common in practice. Based on the extensive behavioral research on advertising repetition and advertising wearout, we extend the classical Nerlove and Arrow (1962) model by incorporating the notions of repetition wearout, copy wearout, and ad quality restoration. Repetition wearout is a result of excessive frequency because ad viewers perceive that there is nothing new to be gained from processing the ad, they withdraw their attention, or they become unmotivated to react to advertising information. Copy wearout refers to the decline in ad quality due to passage of time independent of the level of frequency. Ad quality restoration is the enhancement of ad quality during media hiatus as a consequence of viewers forgetting the details of the advertised messages, thus making ads appear “like new” when reintroduced later. The proposed model has the property that, when wearout effects are present, a strategy of pulsing is superior to continuous advertising even when the advertising response function is concave. This is illustrated by a numerical example that compares the total awareness generated by a single concentrated pulse of varying duration (blitz schedules) and continuous advertising (the even schedule). This property can be explained by the tension between the pressure to spend the fixed media budget quickly to avoid copy wearout and the opposing pressure to spread out the media spending over time to mitigate repetition wearout. The proposed model is empirically tested by using brand-level data from two advertising awareness tracking studies that also include the actual spending schedules. The first data set is for a major cereal brand, while the other is for a brand of milk chocolate. Such advertising tracking studies are now a common and popular means for evaluating advertising effectiveness in many markets (e.g., Millward Brown, MarketMind). In the empirical tests, the model parameters are estimated by using the Kalman filter procedure, which is eminently suited for dynamic models because it attends to the intertemporal dependencies in awareness build-up and decay via the use of conditional densities. The estimated parameters are statistically significant, have the expected signs, and are meaningful from both theoretical and managerial viewpoints. The proposed model fits both the data sets rather well and better than several well-known advertising models, namely, the Vidale-Wolfe, Brandaid, Litmus, and Tracker models, but not decisively better than the Nerlove-Arrow model. However, unlike the Nerlove-Arrow model, the proposed model yields different total awareness for different strategies of spending the same fixed budget, thus allowing media planners to discriminate among several media schedules. Given the empirical support for the model, the paper presents an implementable approach for utilizing it to evaluate large numbers of alternative media schedules and determine the best set of media schedules for consideration in media planning. This approach is based on an algorithm that combines a genetic algorithm with the Kalman filter procedure. The paper presents the results of applying this approach in the case studies of the cereal and milk chocolate brands. The form of the best advertising spending strategies in each case was a pulsing strategy, and there were many schedules that were an improvement over the media schedule actually used in each campaign. }

A vast amount of work in online advertising has been focused on optimizing banner display advertising campaigns where the main goal lies in direct response metrics, often as clicks or conversions. In this paper, we explore the newly popularized space of online video advertising, where brand recognition is the key focus. We propose a framework based on a feedback mechanism where we optimize multiple video specific performance indicators while making sure the delivery constraints (budget and user reach) of advertisers are satisfied. While our main focus is on improving metrics such as engagement (amount of view time), and viewability (whether a campaign is within eyesight of a user), we also discuss the possibilities of expanding to other metrics. We demonstrate the benefit of our framework via empirical results in multiple real-world advertising campaigns. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first paper that deals with the unique challenges arising from the nature of online video advertising.},

abstract = {Taobao, as the largest online retail platform in the world, provides billions of online display advertising impressions for millions of advertisers every day. For commercial purposes, the advertisers bid for specific spots and target crowds to compete for business traffic. The platform chooses the most suitable ads to display in tens of milliseconds. Common pricing methods include cost per mille (CPM) and cost per click (CPC). Traditional advertising systems target certain traits of users and ad placements with fixed bids, essentially regarded as coarse-grained matching of bid and traffic quality. However, the fixed bids set by the advertisers competing for different quality requests cannot fully optimize the advertisers' key requirements. Moreover, the platform has to be responsible for the business revenue and user experience. Thus, we proposed a bid optimizing strategy called optimized cost per click (OCPC) which automatically adjusts the bid to achieve finer matching of bid and traffic quality of page view (PV) request granularity. Our approach optimizes advertisers' demands, platform business revenue and user experience and as a whole improves traffic allocation efficiency. We have validated our approach in Taobao display advertising system in production. The online A/B test shows our algorithm yields substantially better results than previous fixed bid manner.},

abstract = { Abstract Online systems promise to improve advertisement targeting via the massive and detailed data available. However, there often is too few data on exactly the outcome of interest, such as purchases, for accurate campaign evaluation and optimization (due to low conversion rates, cold start periods, lack of instrumentation of offline purchases, and long purchase cycles). This paper presents a detailed treatment of proxy modeling, which is based on the identification of a suitable alternative (proxy) target variable when data on the true objective is in short supply (or even completely nonexistent). The paper has a two-fold contribution. First, the potential of proxy modeling is demonstrated clearly, based on a massive-scale experiment across 58 real online advertising campaigns. Second, we assess the value of different specific proxies for evaluating and optimizing online display advertising, showing striking results. The results include bad news and good news. The most commonly cited and used proxy is a click on an ad. The bad news is that across a large number of campaigns, clicks are not good proxies for evaluation or for optimization: clickers do not resemble buyers. The good news is that an alternative sort of proxy performs remarkably well: observed visits to the brand's website. Specifically, predictive models built based on brand site visits—which are much more common than purchases—do a remarkably good job of predicting which browsers will make a purchase. The practical bottom line: evaluating and optimizing campaigns using clicks seems wrongheaded; however, there is an easy and attractive alternative—use a well-chosen site-visit proxy instead. }

  abstract={Feedback control is critical in the scalable optimization of Internet advertising, and it is, therefore, an enabling technology. However, it is challenging to model the plant and design the controller because the plant is nonlinear, time varying, stochastic, and poorly known. A closed-loop system model easily becomes unrealistic or extremely complicated and intractable to analyze.}

abstract = { This article focuses on whether banner advertising affects purchasing patterns on the Internet. Using a behavioral database that consists of customer purchases at a Web site along with individual advertising exposure, the authors measure the impact of banner advertising on current customers' probabilities of repurchase, while accounting for duration dependence. The authors model the probability of a current customer making a purchase in any given week (since the last purchase) with a survival model that uses a flexible, piecewise exponential hazard function. The advertising covariates are purely advertising variables and advertising/individual browsing variables. The model is cast in a hierarchical Bayesian framework, which enables the authors to obtain individual advertising response parameters. The results show that the number of exposures, number of Web sites, and number of pages all have a positive effect on repeat purchase probabilities, whereas the number of unique creatives has a negative effect. Returns from targeting are the highest for the number of advertising exposures. The findings also add to the general advertising literature by showing that advertising affects the purchase behavior of current (versus new) customers. }

abstract = {Abstract This paper provides the first in-depth study of the algorithmic questions involved in the scheduling of space-sharing for Internet advertising. We consider the scheduling problem where each advertisement is specified by a geometry and a display frequency. Given a set of ads, a schedule of the ads specifies which ads are to be displayed at the same time. The objective is find a schedule of the ads such that (1) each ad is displayed with the correct frequency, (2) each ad is allocated enough space for the specified geometry, (3) all the ads to be displayed simultaneously can be arranged in the space available for advertising. We demonstrate that an optimal schedule can be determined by finding a solution to a new variant of the bin packing problem that we introduce. In this new variant, there are a number of copies of each item to be placed into the bins. In addition to the usual bin packing requirements, all copies of an item must be placed in different bins. In this paper, we provide an efficient algorithm that finds the optimal solution to a restricted version of the new bin packing problem. This algorithm also provides a 2-approximation for the unrestricted case. We then apply this approximation to the problem of scheduling space-sharing for Internet advertising. We obtain a 2-approximation to the problem of minimizing the space requirements of a given set of ads, as well as to the problem of determining the best subset of the ads that can be scheduled with a given space constraint. We also consider an on-line version of the ad scheduling problem, where requests to purchase ad space arrive sequentially and after each request arrives, a decision must be made whether or not to sell the requested space without knowledge of future requests. We provide an algorithm that makes these decisions in a manner that is the best possible for any on-line algorithm. Copyright © 2002 John Wiley \& Sons, Ltd.},

  abstract={Many web sites provide free services to users. The revenue for these sites is dependent on the advertisements they place on their web pages. For these firms, therefore, the optimal placing of advertisements on their web pages becomes a critical issue. In a given planning horizon, we assume that the number of advertisements available for placement on a web site is greater than the available space. The site, therefore, needs to determine the optimal allocation of advertisement space. We develop a hybrid genetic algorithm (GA) that uses problem specific knowledge during the evolution of solutions to solve this problem. Our initial computational results show that the hybrid GA performs exceptionally well in the sense that it provides optimal or near optimal solutions for a variety of problems.}

abstract = {Most online advertisement systems in place today use the concept of consumer targeting: each user is identified and, according to his or her system setup, browsing habits and available off-line information, categorized in order to customize the advertisements for highest user responsiveness. This constant monitoring of a user's online habits, together with the trend to centralize this data and link it with other databases, continuously nurtures fears about the growing lack of privacy in a networked society. In this paper, we propose a novel technique of adapting online advertisement to a user's short term interests in a non-intrusive way. As a proof-of-concept we implemented a dynamic advertisement selection system able to deliver customized advertisements to users of an online search service or Web directory. No user-specific data elements are collected or stored at any time. Initial experiments indicate that the system is able to improve the average click-through rate substantially compared to random selection methods.}

abstract = { Despite the slowdown in the economy, advertisement revenue remains a significant source of income for many Internet-based organizations. Banner advertisements form a critical component of this income, accounting for 40 to 50\% of the total revenue. There are considerable gains to be realized through the efficient scheduling of banner advertisements. This problem has received only limited attention in the literature. This paper introduces formulations for an important version of the banner advertisement scheduling problem. Two solution approaches, one based on Lagrangean decomposition and the other based on column generation, are presented, along with extensive results based on 1,500 randomly generated data sets. These results suggest that, while both approaches do very well in general, column generation consistently performs better than Lagrangean decomposition, giving gaps of 0.0004\% or better in 4.4 seconds or less, even on relatively large problem instances. }
